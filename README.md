5. **Visualization**:
    - Generate and visualize the frequency of the top 20 words in the text.
    - Create and display a word cloud visualization of processed text data.

6. **Interactive Commands**: Utilize command-line interface commands for actions like displaying metrics, limiting results, searching for specific words, and generating visualizations.

7. **Summarize Text**: Summarize text using a BERT Extractive Summarizer.

8. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Perform sentiment analysis on the text.
    - Provides insights into sentiment polarity and subjectivity.

<h2><a id="ques">:grey_question: FAQ</a></h2>

### Q: What is Pyquantify?

Pyquantify is a tool designed for in-depth analysis of textual data, focusing on extracting meaning and linguistic insights. It provides features like word frequency, morphology, and metrics generation, enhancing data exploration and visualization.

### Q: Why Develop Pyquantify as a Semantic Profiler?

Pyquantify was created for the DSA subject in the fifth semester of college. The goal was to offer a versatile NLP tool, empowering users to analyze and profile text efficiently. The tool's features aim to deepen understanding and exploration of linguistic aspects within textual data.

### Q: Why Did Pyquantify evolve from a Word Frequency Counter?

Originally conceived as a word frequency counter, Pyquantify's development took a different direction. The decision to expand its capabilities was driven by the desire to create a more comprehensive tool for natural language processing. The project evolved to encompass semantic profiling, offering a richer set of features such as morphology analysis, metrics generation, and enhanced data visualization. This shift aimed to provide users with a more powerful and versatile solution for exploring and understanding textual data beyond simple word frequency analysis.

### Q: Why the name change from NLPFreq to Pyquantify?

NLPFreq felt limiting and didn't capture the full scope of the project. Pyquantify more accurately reflects its capabilities as a Python-based tool for quantitative data analysis.

<hr/>

**Note:** Pyquantify has undergone thorough testing on Linux, and its functionality is confirmed to work seamlessly. However, it's important to note that when running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), certain features may have limited functionality due to the absence of the complete Linux toolset in the WSL environment.
