Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language. NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, from basic ones like text classification and sentiment analysis to more complex processes such as language translation and summarization. The goal is to bridge the gap between the natural, nuanced way humans communicate and the structured, logical world of computers. NLP applications are widespread, found in virtual assistants, chatbots, language translation services, and more. Advances in deep learning and neural networks have significantly enhanced the accuracy and capabilities of NLP systems, making them integral to various industries, including healthcare, finance, and customer service.
